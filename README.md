> Let the corals grow in peace and feed them with energy and light.

This is a toy about letting things take their time. It runs on an Android phone and uses its sensors to focus interactions towards slow processes and subvert the attention relationships between device and player. You can read a detailed [discussion here](https://github.com/enricllagostera/shellphone/blob/master/DISCUSSION.md) of the design ideas behind shellphone, with references and documentation of its creation process.

By publishing shellphone's source code and documentation, my goal is that people interested in creating similar games or toys can access an example, a starting point. It was difficult to find open tools or samples of projects using sensors in an approachable way, so by making this public I might help save some of this effort in the future. The shellphone project contains a few different samples on how to use Android phone sensors (via the amazing [Android Sensors for Unity](https://github.com/mmeiburg/unityAndroidSensors) library) in a game, as well as a few ideas on how to map them into specific interactions.

## Getting started

The shellphone project was made using the Unity (version ) game engine, with the Android platform module installed. This repository contains the full Unity project, including both the [Android Sensors for Unity](https://github.com/mmeiburg/unityAndroidSensors) code and assets as well as shellphone specific materials.

To install, you can download this repository, extract it to your computer and open the folder in Unity. There you can access all scenes and code.
